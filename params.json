First it will try to move the player to the highest\r\n  ranking player in the squad (including vehicles if it has a free space). If it fails it will try with\r\n  faction and side player units.\r\n  * If a player disconnects and later reconnects, the following information is stored:\r\n    * Loadout.\r\n    * ACE 3 advanced fatigue, ACE roles (Medic, engineer, ...), ACE Overheating, ACE hearing, ...\r\n    * ACE Medical is **NOT** supported at the moment.\r\n* Custom respawn system fully configurable through mission parameters:\r\n  * Support for unlimited respawns, tickets (side or player based) or no respawns.\r\n  * Compatible with ALiVE Multispawn and ACE 3 Revive system.\r\n  * Side, faction and group dependant spawn points can be configured.\r\n  * Triggers a mission ending if certain conditions are met.\r\n* Group callsign configuration.\r\n* Unit equipment configuration depending on roles.\r\n* Briefing template depending on the faction, including a especial briefing for administrators.\r\n* Introduction screen sequence (UAV or simple text) depending on the unit's faction.\r\n* Zeus for administrator automatically added.

A brief description is given below:\r\n\r\n* \"\\\" (root foler): This folder contains those files that are essential for the mission and the template:\r\ndescription.ext, init.sqf, mission.sqm, bmt_components.hpp and this Readme file.\r\n* \"\\dac\": This folder contains the configuration files for the addon Dynamic-AI-Creator. The mission\r\ncreator does not need to place External DAC Logic since this is handled automatically by the template. This\r\ntool, created by Silola, allow generating AI quickly and dynamically and it allows to save some resources\r\nthrough AI caching techniques. More information can be found in\r\nhttp://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?176926-DAC-V3-1-(Dynamic-AI-Creator)-released.\r\n* \"\\externalScripts\": This folder contains third party addons and scripts.\r\n  * \"\\externalScripts\\T8\": The `T8 Units` script by T-800a.
