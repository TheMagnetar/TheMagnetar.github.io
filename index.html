## Structure

The template has its files organised in folders that share the same topic, with only two folders being
relevant for the majority of the missions. A brief description is given below:

* "\" (root foler): This folder contains those files that are essential for the mission and the template:
description.ext, init.sqf, mission.sqm, bmt_components.hpp and this Readme file.
* "\dac": This folder contains the configuration files for the addon Dynamic-AI-Creator. The mission
creator does not need to place External DAC Logic since this is handled automatically by the template. This
tool, created by Silola, allow generating AI quickly and dynamically and it allows to save some resources
through AI caching techniques. More information can be found in
