<a id="basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic usage</h1>

<p>The basic usage of the Arma 3 Basic Mission Template is quite simple. The mission editor focuses only on
modifying the files under the <code>missionConfig</code> folder in order to modify the introduction and the ending,
unit equipment, radio frequencies, briefing and debriefing. This is a process that can be summarised in the
following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mission preparation: mission editing and copying the template scripts into the mission folder.</li>
<li>Define mission parameters, debriefing addons and other properties.</li>
<li>Assign a role and equipment to playable units.</li>
<li>Write a briefing.</li>
<li>Configure the introduction screen.</li>
<li>Check that everything works and disable debug.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="1-mission-preparation" class="anchor" href="#1-mission-preparation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. Mission preparation</h2>

<p>This step is the mission preparation itself. Simply create the mission, place playable and enemy units,
triggers and markers. If using ACE 3, ACRE 2 or DAC, there is no need to place modules since the template
will configure each addon at mission start. It is recommended, specially if DAC or ACE 3 are used, to give a
variable name to playable units.</p>

<p>Once the basic mission layout is finished, the mission template files and scripts can be copied into the
mission folder. From now on, <strong>the mission will have to be executed in a Multiplayer environment</strong>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="2-definition-of-mission-parameters-addons-and-other-properties" class="anchor" href="#2-definition-of-mission-parameters-addons-and-other-properties" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Definition of mission parameters, addons and other properties</h2>

<p>Once all the files are in the mission folder, it is time to start customising them. All the files that need
to be modified can be found in <code>missionConfig</code> folder. In the Basic Mission Template, the description.ext
file does not need to be changed. It is instead divided into smaller files which help focusing on the task
at hand. This is the suggested order of tweaking the files:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>bmt_missionConfig.hpp</code>: Type of game, number of players, mission name, author, overview text, ...</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_missionDebriefing.hpp</code>: Different mission endings.</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_init.sqf</code>: Scripts that are included in <code>init.sqf</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_components_addons.hpp</code>: Determines which addons are going to be automatically configured by the
template. However, if the PBO  is not found, the scripts will not execute.</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_missionParameters_definition.hpp</code>: Default mission parameters.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="21-mission-configuration" class="anchor" href="#21-mission-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1. Mission configuration</h3>

<p>In this phase basic mission configuration is performed.</p>

<h4>
<a id="211-loading-and-mission-selection-screens" class="anchor" href="#211-loading-and-mission-selection-screens" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1.1. Loading and mission selection screens</h4>

<p>The following entries define information that is shown during the loading screen or the mission selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specify the mission name (<code>onLoadName</code>).</li>
<li>Add a brief mission description (<code>onLoadMission</code>). It will be shown in the loading screen.</li>
<li>Specify the author of the mission (<code>author</code>). It will be shown in the loading screen.</li>
<li>Add a more detailed mission description (<code>overviewText</code>). This entry is shown when selecting which
mission is launched.</li>
<li>Modify the links to the pictures shown during the loading screen (<code>loadScreen</code>) and during the mission
selection screen (<code>overviewPicture</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="212-join-in-progress-jip-configuration" class="anchor" href="#212-join-in-progress-jip-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1.2. Join-in-Progress (JIP) configuration</h4>

<p>Next it is time to define if Join-in-Progress (JIP) is allowed through all the mission or if it is denied
after a certain amount of  time (<code>bmt_config_jipAllowedTime</code>). The value entered should be in seconds. If
JIP is disabled (see section 2.4) this value is ignored.</p>

<p>The server administrator can allow, deny or extend the JIP allowed time from administrator's briefing (see
2.1.4).</p>

<h4>
<a id="213-respawn-configuration" class="anchor" href="#213-respawn-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1.3. Respawn configuration</h4>

<p>The Arma 3 Basic Mission Template has the respawn of type <code>BASE</code> as default. This is done in order to have
more control over JIP and the number of respawns. If used in combination with the respawn template
<code>bmt_respawn</code> the following options are available when configuring the respawn
(<code>bmt_config_numAllowedRespawns</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited respawns: Enter a value of -99.</li>
<li>Respawn is disabled: Enter a value of 0.</li>
<li>Limited number of respawns: Enter a positive value. If ACE 3 Revive is enabled this will limit the number
of Revives instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>This template is compatible with ACE 3 Revive. In addition it will enter spectator mode when waiting for
respawn using either ACE 3 Spectator mode or End Game Spectator mode. Radio mods like TFAR or ACRE 2 are
also supported.</p>

<p>Last, the amount of seconds between respawns has to be modified (<code>respawnDelay</code> for players,
<code>respawnVehicleDelay</code> for vehicles).</p>

<a id="214-information-for-administrators-briefing" class="anchor" href="#214-information-for-administrators-briefing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.1.4. Information for administrators (briefing)</h4>

<p>The following entries should be modified in order to configure information useful for administrators. The
following entries are displayed only to the server administrator at the briefing screen as a separate
entry:</p>

<ul>
<li>List of addons  with the corresponding version number (<code>bmt_config_testedAddons</code>).</li>
<li>Mission version (<code>bmt_config_missionVersion</code>).</li>
<li>Collaborators (<code>bmt_config_missionCollaborators</code>). If using this template the entry
<em>TheMagnetar (A3-BMT)</em> <strong>must be present</strong>.</li>
<li>Mission difficulty (<code>bmt_config_missionDifficulty</code>).</li>
<li>Mission summary for administrators (<code>bmt_config_missionSummary</code>). Do the administrators need to take a
certain role as a Zeus?</li>
<li>Additional notes and remarks (<code>bmt_config_missionNotesAndRemarks</code>).</li>
<li>List of different mission endings. The administrator can trigger any of them at will.</li>
<li>JIP control allows the administrator to deny, allow or extend the JIP allowed time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any additional scripts that need to be executed during <code>init.sqf</code>, they can be added in the
<code>/missionConfig/bmt_init.sqf</code> file. All the scripts and calls included in this file are executed after the
template's scripts (JIP, ACRE and TFAR, ...) since it is included at the end of the <code>init.sqf</code> file.</p>

<p>The next step consists of defining the different mission endings that are going to be triggered once
certain conditions are met. First the entries shown during the debreifing screen must be added in
<code>/missionConfig/bmt_missionDebriefing.hpp</code>. Any of the present entries can be removed at will. However, if
the <code>bmt_respawn</code> Respawn template is used, the entry labelled as <code>Disaster</code> <em>must be present</em>: the mission
will end once all allied units are dead as long as they do not have a possibility of respawning.</p>

<p>Each of the entries in this file are going to be added to the administrator briefing. The administrator has
then the possibility to trigger manually any ending.</p>

<h4>
<a id="232-ending-conditions" class="anchor" href="#232-ending-conditions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.3.2. Ending conditions</h4>

<p>The following step is to define which conditions trigger a specific ending. This is done in the
<code>/missionConfig/endMission/functions/fn_endMission.sqf</code> file and requires a bit of programming. This file
should contain as many endings as entries in the <code>/missionConfig/bmt_missionDebriefing.hpp</code>. An example
of such entry can be:</p>

<pre><code>if (destroyedAssets == numberAssets) then {
    ["EndingSuccess1", true] spawn BIS_fnc_endMission;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The ending labelled as <code>EndingSuccess1</code> is activated once the number of destroyed assets is equal to the
number of assets to be destroyed.</p>

<p>By itself, the function <code>bmt_fnc_endMission</code> does not do anything. It is not an Event Handler. Instead,
this function is placed usually inside a trigger activation field. Note that it has to be executed in all
the machines at once. A call of this function looks like:</p>

<p><code>[] remoteExecCall ["bmt_fnc_endMission, 0, true];</code></p>

<h3>
<a id="24-addons-and-default-mission-parameters" class="anchor" href="#24-addons-and-default-mission-parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.4. Addons and default mission parameters</h3>

<p>With the mission basic parameters and the different endings configured, it is now the turn to configure
the scripts in the template that are going to be executed.</p>

<ul>
<li>To determine which addons are going to be configured by the scripts in the template, the file
<code>/missionConfig/bmt_components_addons.hpp</code> has to be modified. Simply comment the line of any addon that is
not going to be used to disable the scripts. Note however, that if the PBO file is not loaded, the scripts
will not execute. This is useful when playing a mission with two different radio mods (ACRE 2 or TFAR) for
example, without having to change the mission itself.</li>
<li>The scripts in the template can be configured also at mission start through parameters. The default
values can be changed in <code>/missionConfig/bmt_missionParameters_definitions.hpp</code>. Disabling a component in
<code>/missionConfig/bmt_components_addons.hpp</code> will also hide the affected parameters in the mission lobby
screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="3-equipment-and-radio-frequencies" class="anchor" href="#3-equipment-and-radio-frequencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Equipment and radio frequencies</h2>

<h3>
<a id="31-equipment-and-callsign" class="anchor" href="#31-equipment-and-callsign" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 Equipment and callsign</h3>

<p>The <em>Arma 3 Basic Mission Template (A3-BMT)</em> provides with scripts to equip units and vehicles that are
JIP safe. One can configure with a single line of code both the equipment and the callsign of a playabe
unit. Simply, the following function has to be called inside the unit's <em>Init</em> field. Below are some
examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit is a squad leader with callsign <em>Alpha 1-1</em>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Alpha 1", 1, "sl", this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Unit is a medic with callsign <em>Bravo 1-3</em>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Bravo 1", 3, "sl", this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<p>The equipment each unit will get depends on the faction that the unit belogns to. This can also be
overwritten by specifying the faction as the fifth argument.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit is a rifleman with callsign <em>Alpha 2-3</em> and has the equipment of the RHS US Army (D) faction despite
belonging to the vanilla BLUFOR faction:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Alpha 2", 3, "rfl", this, "rhs_faction_usarmy_d"] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to pass additional configuration options to further configure the equipment if it is
supported by the particular faction function. In this case the unit role is substituted by an array of
strings. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit is a grenadier with callsign <em>Charlie 1-1</em>, and uses a variant of the uniform which is with short
sleeves:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Charlie 1", 1, ["gr", "shortSleeve"], this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<p>For vehicles, crates and ammo boxes, the <code>bmt_fnc_configUnit</code> cannot be used. Instead, the inventory of
such objects has to be configured through the <code>bmt_fnc_configEquipment</code> function. Note that while the third
argument of this function is optional for regular units, vehicles, crates and ammo boxes must include the
faction entry for the equipment function to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ammo Box for the RHS USMC Woodland:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["ammobox", this, "rhs_faction_usmc_wd"] call bmt_fnc_configEquipment;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Car with CSAT equipment:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["car", this, "opf_f"] call bmt_fnc_configEquipment;
</code></pre>

<a id="32-radio-assignment-and-frequencies" class="anchor" href="#32-radio-assignment-and-frequencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2 Radio assignment and frequencies</h3>

<h3>
<a id="321-radio-assignment" class="anchor" href="#321-radio-assignment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2.1. Radio assignment</h3>

<p>Which radios are given to a particular role can be configured in the
<code>/missionCOnfig/core/functions/fn_core_commonVariables.sqf</code> file. The only interesting variables for the
moment are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>bmt_array_riflemanRadio</code>: like the AN/PRC-343.</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_array_shortRangeRadio</code>: like AN/PRC-152 or AN/PRC-148.</li>
<li>
<code>bmt_array_longRangeRadio</code>: radios in the backpack like AN/PRC-117F.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that the unit role defined inside the <code>bmt_fnc_configUnit</code> function is inside one of these
arrays. Otherwise no radio will be assigned. For more detailed information on radio configuration, please
refer to page 3b. Radio configuration of this wiki.</p>

<h3>
<a id="322-radio-frequencies" class="anchor" href="#322-radio-frequencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2.2. Radio frequencies</h3>

<p>The radio frequencies assigned to a callsign can be configured in the next three arrays:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>bmt_array_groups</code> defines the different callsings, with the first entry of the inner arrays defining the
general channel within, for example, a squad while the following entries define the fire teams within
that squad. For example:</p>

<pre><code>bmt_array_groups = [["Wolf 1", "Wolf 1-1", "Wolf 1-2", "Wolf 1-3"]];
</code></pre>

<p>would define a squad labeled <em>Wolf 1</em> with three fire teams: <em>Wolf 1-1</em>, <em>Wolf 1-2</em> and <em>Wolf 1-3</em>.
It is important that any callsign defined in the <code>bmt_fnc_configUnit</code> function call to be defined in this
array, with the first string matching any of the squad identifiers and the second  argument a fire team.
Therefore, for the previous example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The unit is assigned to <em>Wolf 1-2</em>.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Wolf 1", 2, "sl", this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The following is an invalid entry since fire team <em>Wolf 1-4</em> is not defined.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Wolf 1", 4, "sl", this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The following is also invalid since squad <em>Wolf A</em> is not defined.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>["Wolf A", 2, "sl", this] call bmt_fnc_configUnit;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bmt_array_frequenciesShortRange</code> configures which frequencies are assigned to a particular callsign.
These frequencies are only configured in short range radios (AN/PRC 152 and AN/PRC 148 and, in case of
TFAR, AN/PRC 343 as well). Each array entry must have exactly the same number of elements as the
<code>bmt_array_groups</code> array. Following the previous example with the <em>Wolf 1</em> squad:</p>

<pre><code>bmt_array_frequenciesShortRange  = [["200", "201", "202", "203"]];
</code></pre>

<p>would assign 200 KHz as frequency for the general <em>Wolf 1</em> squad, and 201 KHz, 202 KHz and 203 KHz would
be the frequencies assigned to fire teams <em>Wolf 1-1</em>, <em>Wolf 1-2</em> and <em>Wolf 1-3</em> respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bmt_array_frequenciesLongRange</code> is the equivalent for long rage radios. In this array, only one entry
must be present per squad.</p>

<pre><code>bmt_array_frequenciesLongRange = [["40"]];
</code></pre>

<p>Would configure the long range radio of squad <em>Wolf 1</em> to 40 KHz.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="4-briefing" class="anchor" href="#4-briefing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4. Briefing</h2>

<p>Next step is to define the briefing information that each playable unit, depending on its faction, will be
able to read. The templates included in each of the files in
<code>/missionConfig/briefing/scripts/bmt_briefing_*.sqf</code> follows the scheme shown below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>SITREP:</strong> Serves as a background for the mission and it sets its tone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mission and Execution:</strong> Brief description of the mission and how it is envisaged to be accomplished.</li>
<li>
<strong>Intel:</strong> Intelligence report on enemy or allied units or any other mission relevant information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Logistics:</strong> Description of the available supports (CAS, MEDEVAC, ...) or resupply options available to the players.</li>
<li>
<strong>Radio frequencies:</strong> Summary of radio frequencies and callsigns.</li>
<li>
<strong>Credits:</strong> not mission relevant, but details mission author and collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other entry can be easily added using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Topic Title","Topic Text"]];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the last entries are displayed first in the briefing screen.</p>

<h2>
<a id="5-introduction-screen" class="anchor" href="#5-introduction-screen" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5. Introduction screen</h2>

<p>Introduction screen serves a double purpose. On one side it allows the scripts that are executed in
<code>init.sqf</code> to make their job without the player noticing. On the other, it can serve as to give some
basic information such as time, location and mission name.</p>

<p>The mission introduction screen can be configured in <code>/missionConfig/intro/scripts/bmt_intro.sqf</code>. Each
faction supported in the <em>Arma 3 Basic Mission Template</em> has its own entry, allowing a higher degree of
customisation in the displayed text.</p>

<p>Two kind of introduction screens are currently available: <code>blackScreen</code>, <code>playerCamera</code> and <code>uavFeed</code>. The first
simply fades from black, the second is a virtual camera focused on the player and the third is aUAV camera. It can
be selected by modifying the variable <code>_introType</code>.</p>

<p>In case of <code>blackScreen</code> only the <code>_missionLocation</code> variable can be customised, but the <code>uavFeed</code> can have
its marker, rotation, angle and speed customised. The <code>playerCamera</code>allows customising the animations, the use of
night vision and the mission location.</p>

<p>The last step is to test that everything is working: triggers, equipment, callsigns, radio frequencies, ...
Once everything is working as intended, it is time to disable the Debug information by default. This is
done by changing the line <code>#define BMT_DEBUG 1</code> to <code>#define BMT_DEBUG 0</code> in
<code>/missionConfig/bmt_missionParameters_definitions.hpp</code>. Doing so will disable those messages that are not
critical.</p>
